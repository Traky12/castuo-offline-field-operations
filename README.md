## Architecture governance boundary

This repository is governed through the CASTÚO-SYSTEM evidence chain. Its current role, visibility boundary, required provenance, security baseline and promotion rules are defined in [`docs/CASTUO_ARCHITECTURE_GOVERNANCE.md`](docs/CASTUO_ARCHITECTURE_GOVERNANCE.md). A repository artifact or green workflow proves only the declared scope; it does not by itself prove certification, production operation, funding, customer contracts or commercial success.

## Private-cloud and evidence boundary

This repository is part of the CASTÚO-SYSTEM private-cloud target architecture. Its repository scope does not by itself prove cloud provisioning, DNS, production operation, customer traction, financing, certification or independent validation. The service identity is a governed target boundary until a deployment record, access control, health check, observability, backup, restore, rollback, owner and dated Evidence Center record are published.

The public state model is `DOCUMENTED` → `IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL` → `TESTED` → `VALIDATED` → `OPERATIONAL`. OpenClaw and n8n, where referenced, are optional compatibility adapters and not the sovereign governance control plane.\n

<!-- CASTUO-GOVERNED-README-BLOCK:START -->
## CASTÚO-SYSTEM governed operating model

This repository is part of the CASTÚO-SYSTEM evidence operating system. Its status is governed by implementation, evidence and promotion gates; repository presence or vendor language is not evidence of operational maturity.

### Three-plane architecture

| Plane | Role | Repository boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Internal control plane | Capabilities, evidence, claims, gates, passports and N3/N4/N5/N6 maturity | This repository's contracts and governed records |
| Competitive intelligence | 1/0/?/N/A comparison, 1D/1V/1R semantics, scenarios and sensitivity | Comparative records remain bounded by provenance |
| External validation | Independent review, reproducible benchmark, field pilot, KPIs and economic evidence | Promotion requires reviewable external evidence |

### Sovereign reference architecture

CASTÚO-SYSTEM uses an explicit authority hierarchy: `todo.md` records the operational backlog; `CASTUO-SYSTEM-OPERATING-INDEX.md` governs architecture, gates and claims; typed contracts and passports define executable semantics; tests, scans, SBOM and benchmarks provide bounded evidence; PR reviews and protected branches govern change; independent, field and economic evidence are required for E3/N5 promotion. A higher-level source is authoritative only within its domain: a README cannot override a contract, a local test cannot convert a remote 403 into zero alerts, and a commit reference is not field evidence.

Ownership is explicit. Platform owns dashboard and contracts; governance owns README and index; assurance owns passports and claims; security owns vault and connectors; repository maintainers own remote Security and quality; independent reviewers and pilot owners own E3/N5 evidence. Every change follows `task → artifact → branch → commit → PR → review/checks → merge → checkpoint → passport`. No automation may self-approve, merge protected branches, register secrets or promote claims without the required gate.

The sovereignty reference is [`docs/governance/CASTUO-SOVEREIGN-REFERENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/blob/main/docs/governance/CASTUO-SOVEREIGN-REFERENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md). It defines data sovereignty, external dependency boundaries, recovery rules and rollback responsibilities. The machine-readable change policy is [`docs/governance/CASTUO-COMMIT-GOVERNANCE-POLICY.json`](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/blob/main/docs/governance/CASTUO-COMMIT-GOVERNANCE-POLICY.json); it is normative for commit messages, PR review, required checks, ownership, claim boundaries and rollback.

### Claim discipline

`CAPABILITY` is not `EVIDENCE`; `EVIDENCE` is not `MATURITY`; `MATURITY` is not `CLAIM`; and `CLAIM` is not `COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE`. The binary matrix uses `1D` for primary-source declaration, `1V` for reproducible verification, `1R` for independent reproduction, `?` for unknown, `0` for absent in the tested boundary and `N/A` for non-comparable scope. Unknown is never silently converted into absence or proof.

### Reproducibility benchmark

The current competitive protocol is **S-001 Evidence-Ready Field Operations**: the same operational task, inputs and connectivity failure condition are replayed through CASTÚO and an alternative implementation. Its metrics cover continuity, recovery, provenance, evidence completeness, reviewability and claim generation. `P2` versions the fixture, `E3` requires independent replay and `N5` requires a signed field pilot with KPIs. A local fixture result is labelled `LOCAL REPRODUCTION / NO FIELD CLAIM`.

### Implemented progress surface

The governed integration currently covers the following evidence-scoped capabilities:

| Capability | Current state | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Secure SaaS connectors | Vault-first intents, rotation, revocation, owner isolation, least-privilege scopes and redacted audit | Real provider selection remains `SECURITY_HOLD` until dual approval |
| Quantum Decision Lab | Deterministic local simulator with evidence budget, heuristic confidence and factor readouts | `LOCAL RESULT / NO CLAIM`; no field or economic evidence implied |
| Assurance P0/P1/P2 | Roadmap, Trust Passports, AI Security Passport, SLO/observability contracts and open-gate register | External review, production restore and remote assurance remain pending |
| Competitive intelligence | 1/0/?/N/A matrix, weighted coverage, evidence completeness and 17 capability passports | `?` is uncertainty; it is never silently converted to 0 or 1 |
| S-001 reproducibility benchmark | Same task, inputs and failure condition; continuity, recovery, provenance, completeness, reviewability and claim generation | P2 fixture, E3 independent replay and N5 field/economic evidence are separate gates |
| Supply-chain controls | Secret scan, SBOM, dependency scan and local dependency result of 0 advisories | Local green status does not prove remote GitHub Security and quality is 0 |
| Traky12 integration | 16 remote repositories classified; 14 governed README PRs open and traceable | Protected main branches require review/checks; forks are excluded |

### Integral improvement and sovereign state

CASTÚO-SYSTEM evolved from dispersed repositories and capabilities into a control plane governed by evidence, security and controlled promotion. Its shared sequence is `ecosystem → public index → capability → contract → implementation → evidence → security → trust passport → promotion gate → negative evidence`. The system distinguishes implementation, documentation, validation, maturity, promotion and authorized claims.

The current sovereign model defines one system with explicit roles: `Castuo-system` core, `castuo-evolution` governance, `Cast-o`/`goldfish` assurance and recovery, `castuo-offline-field-operations` field, `castuo-agro-edge` edge, and `Traky12` public baseline. Forks and upstream integrations are not proprietary capability. Security boundaries remain architectural: SaaS secrets stay backend-only behind an approved vault; local scans do not prove remote zero alerts.

The canonical improvement report is [`docs/governance/CASTUO-INTEGRAL-IMPROVEMENT-AND-SOVEREIGN-STATE.md`](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/blob/main/docs/governance/CASTUO-INTEGRAL-IMPROVEMENT-AND-SOVEREIGN-STATE.md). It records the evidence chain, binary competitive matrix, passports, maturity ceilings, recovery lineage and unresolved external gates. Current statuses remain `PENDING`, `SECURITY_HOLD`, `NOT_VERIFIED`, `EVIDENCE_REQUIRED` or `PROMOTION-BLOCKED` where external authorization or evidence is missing.

### OSS reputation and credibility

Reputation is treated as an output of real open-source work, not as a badge-collection target. The profile prioritises useful contributions, technical discussions, clear issues, cross-reviews, co-authored PRs, strong documentation, reproducible releases and organic external use. It does not create trivial PRs, artificial Discussions, mirror accounts, inflated activity, purchased badges or synthetic stars.

The public profile communicates **Founder & Lead Architect of CASTÚO-SYSTEM · Systems Architect · Evidence Engineer · AI Governance & Assurance** and presents CASTÚO as an evidence-governed control plane for distributed operations and AI-enabled systems. `Castuo-system` is the implementation lighthouse; `Traky12` is the public baseline/read-model. The 16-repository inventory is one modular system model, not 16 products. Achievements, stars, commits, releases or follower counts are activity signals, never proof of quality, production, adoption, security, independence or economic outcome.

The complete guardrail strategy is [`docs/governance/CASTUO-OSS-REPUTATION-STRATEGY.md`](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/blob/main/docs/governance/CASTUO-OSS-REPUTATION-STRATEGY.md). Its internal metrics are dated and bounded: useful contributions, valuable technical conversations, substantive co-authored PRs, documentation completeness, reproducible releases and organic interest in the lighthouse repository.

### Canonical public narrative

**CASTÚO-SYSTEM is an evidence-governed control plane for distributed operations and AI-enabled systems, with Evidence-Ready Field Operations as its first commercial wedge.** The first user journey is `Operate offline → preserve evidence → review → export`. This is a bounded product narrative, not a claim of production, customer adoption, field validation or commercial traction.

The public profile is a baseline and read-model: `public baseline → index → claims → evidence links → boundaries`. The 16-repository inventory is one modular system model, not 16 products. Repository roles and authority remain governed by the sovereign reference architecture and operating index.

The confidence progression is `evidence-scoped → independently reproduced → field validated → commercially validated`. The profile makes no comparative claim against named competitors and does not use best-in-class, commercial superiority, certification, autonomy or revenue language without a dated, scope-bound evidence passport. The canonical narrative is [`docs/governance/CASTUO-PUBLIC-NARRATIVE-AND-WEDGE.md`](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/blob/main/docs/governance/CASTUO-PUBLIC-NARRATIVE-AND-WEDGE.md).

### Maturity Acceleration Program G0→N6

The canonical maturity program prioritises evidence industrialisation over horizontal expansion. The order is `security → remote CI → vertical slice → observability/restore → E3 → pilot → payment → repeatability → N6`; a feature is prioritised only when it closes a P0, P1, P2, E3 or G-COMM gate. The program defines one canonical authority per category: `CASTUO-EVOLUTION` for governance, `Castuo-system` for core, `goldfish`/`Cast-o` for assurance, `castuo-offline-field-operations` for field, `castuo-agro-edge` for edge and `Traky12` for public read-model. Copies, workspaces, experiments and upstream forks are projections or non-canonical surfaces.

| Gate | Current boundary | Exit evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `R1-CI-REMOTE` | `BLOCKED` | Remote runner, logs, annotations, artifact, SHA, workflow ID, timestamp and reproducible failure |
| `P0-SECURITY` | `SECURITY_HOLD` | Backend-only vault, approved provider, rotation, revocation, least privilege, dual approval and audit completeness |
| `S-001` | `LOCAL RESULT / NO CLAIM` | Offline, duplicate, reorder, conflict, recovery, envelope, review and claim decision |
| `P1-OPS` | `EVIDENCE_REQUIRED` | Runtime SLOs, incidents, backup/restore checksum and replay |
| `P1-VENDOR-INDEPENDENCE` | `EVIDENCE_REQUIRED` | Same contract and inputs through Adapter A and Adapter B |
| `E3/GATE-R1` | `PENDING` | Frozen commit, fixture, instructions, negative tests, envelope and independent reproduction |
| `N5` | `PENDING` | PILOT-001, baseline, KPI, incident register, signed packets and independent review |
| `N6/G-COMM` | `BLOCKED` | Paid pilot, renewal, second customer/domain, replacement, multi-tenant hardening and SLA |

Evidence strength is `E0 claimed`, `E1 documented`, `E2 locally verified`, `E3 reproducibly verified`, `E4 independently reproduced`, `E5 field validated` and `E6 commercially validated`. The maturity ceiling follows `N3 ≤ E2`, `N4 ≤ E3`, `N5 requires E5` and `N6 requires E6`. `ECR = backed claims / attempted claims` should approach 1 and `Promotion Debt` should reach 0; until then, claims remain bounded.

The complete program is [`docs/governance/CASTUO-MATURITY-ACCELERATION-PROGRAM.md`](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/blob/main/docs/governance/CASTUO-MATURITY-ACCELERATION-PROGRAM.md). It freezes scope creep unless a change closes a named gate.

### Full operating plan transcription

The evolution plan is executed as a controlled chain rather than as an unbounded feature list. **Foundation** establishes repository boundaries, typed contracts, the dashboard and the capability vocabulary. **P0 Secure platform** enforces backend-only credential handling, vault-first intents, least-privilege permissions, rotation, revocation, owner isolation, redacted audit and supply-chain scanning. **P1 Evidence system** formalises sensitivity, provenance, Trust Passports, AI Security Passport, observability, SLOs, backup/restore and diagnostics. **P2 External validation** defines the second implementation, S-001 replay, independent review, field KPIs and economic evidence.

The operational backlog is maintained in `todo.md` and in the master operating index. Each task must preserve an owner, input boundary, expected output, exit criterion, evidence reference and rollback path. Completed work is marked without deleting historical entries. Blocked work remains visible with `BLOCKED`, `SECURITY_HOLD`, `EVIDENCE_REQUIRED` or `NOT_VERIFIED`; an open task is never evidence of capability.

| Control | Required transcription | Promotion rule |
|---|---|---|
| Capability | What the system can do and which repository owns it | Do not infer evidence from capability presence |
| Evidence | Source, contract, test, runtime slice, benchmark or review | Must be reproducible and provenance-linked |
| Maturity | N1–N6 plus P0/P1/P2 and E3/N5 gates | No maturity promotion without the specified gate |
| Claim | Exact permitted statement and audience | Default-deny when passport or gate is incomplete |
| Competitive advantage | Comparative and economic proposition | Prohibited until independent and economic evidence exists |

Every README update is idempotent and PR-governed. The synchronizer updates only the authorised branch, preserves one governed block, excludes forks, records the resulting PR and never writes directly to protected `main`. Recovery uses checkpoints, remote commits and contract artifacts; divergences are reconstructed through a new PR or a named checkpoint, never through destructive history rewriting.

### Pending work register

| Workstream | Current state | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|
| Remote GitHub Security and quality | `BLOCKED` by `security_events` authorization and 403 | Read both main-branch alert tables with an authorized session and record timestamped results |
| Vault provider | `SECURITY_HOLD` with provider-neutral adapter | Approve one backend-only provider and pass rotation/revocation/dual-approval tests |
| Restore and remote diagnostics | `EVIDENCE_REQUIRED` | Complete an isolated restore and a redacted reproducible diagnostic with review |
| External assurance and field evidence | `EVIDENCE_REQUIRED` | Independent S-001 replay, signed review, field KPIs and economic evidence |
| README/plan continuity | PR-governed and recoverable from checkpoints | Merge reviewed PRs only after checks and preserve rollback references |

Open tasks are operational work, not proof of capability. They must remain visible until their exit criteria are met.

### Current boundary

Claims remain evidence-scoped. Do not describe this repository as production-validated, best-in-class, independently reviewed, commercially superior or N5/N6 unless the corresponding passport, evidence package, signed review and gate record are present. The open-gate register is authoritative for vault approval, GitHub security access, remote alerts, production restore, diagnostics and external validation.

### Ledger Explorer and governed export

The dashboard now exposes a read-only **Ledger Explorer** for searching commits by full SHA, subject and timestamp, and for filtering the 14 documentary README PRs by status and governed branch. It provides **Interactive commit and PR history** with selected-item detail, while the **Export PDF** action records the current filtered ledger and README/PR state.

The export is an evidence-scoped operational report generated from `CASTUO-COMMIT-LINEAGE.md`, `TRAKY12-README-SYNC-RESULT.json` and the typed `shared/lineageData.ts` projection. It does not expose secrets, alter GitHub state, merge PRs or assert remote Security and quality status. The current lineage contains 57 commits and the governed README surface remains 14/14 PR-governed.

### Complete commit lineage

The complete local commit lineage is reproduced below from the project Git history. A commit records repository history only; it is not, by itself, field evidence, deployment evidence, a security-zero result or a commercial claim.

### Traceability

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TRAKY12-README-INVENTORY.json` | Repository surface, sensitivity and evidence classification |
| `Competitive Capability Passport` | Capability state, provenance, maturity and forbidden claims |
| `S-001 benchmark` | Reproducible comparison protocol and promotion boundary |
| P0/P1/P2 roadmap | Exit criteria and rollback responsibility |
| `Dashboard checkpoint` | Restorable implementation state and validation result |
| `CASTUO-SYSTEM-OPERATING-INDEX.md` | Master operating plan, task registry, gates, claims boundary, checkpoints and repository traceability |

The master operating index is available at [`docs/governance/CASTUO-SYSTEM-OPERATING-INDEX.md`](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/blob/main/docs/governance/CASTUO-SYSTEM-OPERATING-INDEX.md). This block is a governed integration reference. Repository-specific build, deployment, security and operational instructions remain authoritative in the rest of this README.

### Binary Value Rule v1.0

CASTÚO uses a strict 0/1 promotion rule: a condition is `1` only when primary, traceable and reproducible evidence exists within the declared scope; there is no 0.5 for nearly complete work. The current conservative readout is **3/12**: B01 Architecture defined, B02 Capability implemented and B03 Local reproducible test are `1`; B04–B12 remain `0` because remote CI, independent replay, runtime, observability, field, vendor, vault and commercial evidence are not yet verified.

| Level | Critical binaries | State | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| A / existence | B01+B02+B03 | OPEN | Exists and reproduces locally |
| B / verifiability | B04+B05 | BLOCKED | Remote observation and independent replay required |
| C / operation | B06+B07+B10 | BLOCKED | Runtime, observability and operational security required |
| D / field | B08+B09 | BLOCKED | Field validation and vendor independence required |
| E / business | B11+B12 | BLOCKED | Paid pilot and transferability required |

The immediate critical sequence is `B04 → B05`. A README, planned task, architecture or local test cannot be used to claim remote CI, production runtime, zero remote alerts, field validation, vendor independence, commercial proof or competitive advantage. See [`CASTUO-BINARY-VALUE-RULE.md`](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/blob/main/docs/governance/CASTUO-BINARY-VALUE-RULE.md) for the canonical matrix, evidence requirements, blockers and rollback boundary.

### Binary Bottleneck and Promotion Debt v1.1

The Binary Value Rule separates **external value** (`B01–B12`) from **internal control** (`B13–B15`). The external readout remains **3/12**: B01 architecture, B02 implementation and B03 local reproducibility are `1`; B04–B12 remain `0`. Internal control is **3/3**: B13 change lineage reproducible, B14 professional identity unambiguous and B15 coherent portfolio with visible claim boundaries. These internal controls strengthen governance and traceability but do not become operational, field, commercial or competitive proof.

The **Binary Bottleneck Rule** states that promotion is determined by the first mandatory binary still at `0`. The current bottleneck is `B04 / Remote verification`. **Promotion Debt** counts mandatory external zeros blocking the next promotion path; the current debt is `9`, while **Critical Promotion Debt** is `1` because B04 is the immediate bottleneck. No capability is partially promoted by percentage, document volume, test count or commit count.

| Scope | Binaries | Readout | Meaning |
|---|---|---:|---|
| External value | B01–B12 | 3/12 | Technology value remains bounded by external evidence |
| Internal control | B13–B15 | 3/3 | Traceability, identity and portfolio coherence are controlled locally |
| Immediate bottleneck | B04 | 0 | Remote CI/security verification needs authorized evidence |
| Promotion Debt | B04–B12 zeros | 9 | Mandatory external conditions still block the path |

The next sequence remains `B04 → B05 → B07 → B10 → B06 → B08 → B09 → B11 → B12`. Synthetic vendor parity is not B09 vendor independence, local security is not B10 external security, and a complete ledger is not runtime or field evidence.

### Unified strategy and binary progression

CASTÚO-SYSTEM is governed as a distributed rural-operations system with evidence governance, assurance, edge and field operations. Its operating principles are: **no claim without provenance; no AI deployment without assurance; no scale without security and observability**. The portfolio is intentionally separated into public baseline (`Traky12`), governance control plane (`castuo-evolution`), CI/evidence (`Cast-o`), security/recovery (`goldfish`), edge (`castuo-agro-edge`), offline field operations (`castuo-offline-field-operations`) and the protected private core (`Castuo-system`). Experimental repositories remain bounded laboratories and do not imply production maturity.

The value staircase is binary: `B01–B03` establish existence, `B04–B05` establish external verifiability, `B06–B07+B10` establish controlled operation, `B08–B09` establish field/transferability evidence, and `B11–B12` establish commercial proof. Current external value remains `3/12`; `B13–B15 = 3/3` are internal controls and are not external value. `B04 / Remote verification` remains the Binary Bottleneck, with Promotion Debt `9` and Critical Promotion Debt `1`.

Every new task must identify the binary it could move from `0` to `1` and the evidence that would prove that transition. Documentation, commits, tests, README coverage and local scans improve readiness and traceability, but they do not by themselves close remote CI, independent reproduction, production runtime, field, commercial or competitive claims. The canonical strategy is [`CASTUO-UNIFIED-STRATEGY-AND-BINARY-PROGRESSION.md`](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/blob/main/docs/governance/CASTUO-UNIFIED-STRATEGY-AND-BINARY-PROGRESSION.md).

### Official SaaS identity

The CASTÚO official mark is reused as a single branded asset across the dashboard sidebar, topbar, authentication surface, footer, favicon, social metadata and governed PDF context. The implementation uses the shared `BrandLogo` component and `/manus-storage/pasted_file_tFeqhx_Capturadepantallalogotipo_f0a36c2b.png`; it contains no credentials or dynamic secrets. Brand consistency is presentation metadata only and does not promote production, field, security or commercial evidence.

### Sovereign Control Plane v1

CASTÚO-SYSTEM is a sovereign control, trust, data and evidence infrastructure. Education, biotechnology, drones, robotics, medicine and No-GNSS operations are governed capability domains that inherit the same identity, policy, cryptographic integrity, provenance, evidence, Digital Twin, ledger, incident, recovery and binary-gate architecture.

The authorization rule is conjunctive: `ALLOW = I ∧ A ∧ G ∧ D ∧ T ∧ E ∧ R`. Binary controls decide authorization or promotion; cryptography protects confidentiality/authenticity/integrity; the ledger anchors hashes and traceability; and the Digital Twin represents state, simulation and replay. Blockchain, GaiaChain and Trazalia are not described as encryption or complete security solutions. The canonical contracts are linked from `CASTUO-SOVEREIGN-CONTROL-PLANE-REFERENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

The incident sequence is `detect → identity/signature/replay check → policy → deny/quarantine → preserve → alert → rollback/recover → review`. Domains contribute their capability model, data model, workflows and risk profile; they do not create parallel security fabrics. Federation, field, production, regulatory and commercial states remain evidence-gated and are not implied by documentation or local tests.

The complete implementation plan is persisted in `CASTUO-SOVEREIGN-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`. Local validation for the first increment records secret scan with no credential-shaped literals, dependency scan with zero advisories and an SBOM of 88 direct components. These are local controls and do not close GitHub remote verification, Vault approval, field evidence, assurance or production gates.

### Master Architecture Decision: capability packs and Incident Fabric

CASTÚO-SYSTEM is a **Sovereign Evidence & Trust Control Plane for distributed intelligent systems**. `castuo-evolution` is the authority and governance layer; `Castuo-system` is core execution; `castuo-progress-dashboard` is the observability/management surface; `goldfish` covers security, recovery and assurance; `Cast-o` covers CI and release evidence; edge/offline repositories provide adapters; and `Traky12` remains a limited public read-model.

Education, biotechnology, drones, robotics, medicine and No-GNSS are capability packs, not parallel security platforms. Each pack inherits identity, authorization, device trust, data policy, cryptographic integrity, evidence, audit, recovery and binary gates. A new repository requires an independent ownership, lifecycle, security, deployment or compliance boundary.

`CAP-INCIDENT-001` formalizes the process `DENY → QUARANTINE → INCIDENT-ID → EVIDENCE-HASH → RECOVERY → REVIEW`, including nonce/replay checks, blocked data writes, preserved negative evidence and pending review. This is a governed incident process, not a claim that intrusion is impossible. Clinical functionality remains behind its own regulatory gate; local contracts and tests remain evidence-scoped.

## Capability evolution and dashboard role — 2026-08-18

The progress dashboard is now described within its declared local scope as `GOVERNED_CONTROL_AND_OBSERVABILITY_SURFACE` and as an **Evidence-First Governance, Assurance & Progress Control Surface**. This reflects implemented local contracts and readouts for COMP, capability packs, Incident Fabric, Evidence Graph replay, restore readiness and G0–G10 promotion gates.

`CAP-INCIDENT-001` is implemented and tested within declared local scope: nonce/replay check, deny, quarantine, write block, evidence hash, recovery and review. It is not a claim of total intrusion prevention or production incident response.

CASTÚO-SYSTEM capability packs are bounded modules inheriting common governance, identity, data, evidence, security and promotion semantics. A defined capability pack is not an operationally validated capability. The COMP metamodel is governed and implemented in declared scope, not a full production system metamodel.

Local validation snapshot: 101 tests green, TypeScript/build pass, local secret scan pass, local dependency scan `0 advisories`, and SBOM with 88 direct components. These are dated, scope-bound results. Remote conformance, runtime security assurance, independent review, field validation, production, commercial validation and federation remain pending or not claimed.

External gates remain evidence-required until execution results are independently recorded. `Displayed ≠ Executed`, `101 tests green ≠ production readiness`, `0 advisories ≠ security assurance`, and `Capability Pack ≠ operational capability`.

Governance gap P0: protection of `main` should be verified and, when approved, require PR, review, status checks, CODEOWNERS, no force-push and no branch deletion. The presence of this recommendation does not prove that the setting is enabled.
