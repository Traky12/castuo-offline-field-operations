# CASTÚO Deep Audit — castuo-offline-field-operations — 2026-08-22

This is a repository-local audit snapshot produced during the second ecosystem review. It is a coordination artifact, not an independent certification and not a production authorization.

## Observed inventory

| Dimension | Observation |
|---|---|
| Repository role | CASTÚO ecosystem repository |
| Open PRs observed | 8 |
| PRs reported `CLEAN` | 0 |
| PRs reported `BLOCKED` | 8 |
| Workflow files in local checkout | 2 |
| Evidence/governance files matched | 1 |
| Audit mode | `LOCAL_READOUT · EVIDENCE-SCOPED · PR-ONLY` |

## Cross-repository audit findings

The current integration envelope covers `CAP-001`–`CAP-008`, EvidenceObject and AuthorityObject provenance, Capability Passport, E3 manifest, offline continuity, recovery, replay, SBOM CycloneDX, Gitleaks, pinned GitHub Actions, Code Owner review, human approval and fail-closed promotion. Each repository must still prove only the subset it implements.

The canonical control-plane changes are tracked in [Castuo-system PR #358](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/pull/358); the public profile changes are tracked in [Traky12 PR #18](https://github.com/Traky12/Traky12/pull/18). This repository's contribution must remain linked to those records without copying claims that are not locally reproducible.

## Required audit checks

| Check | Required interpretation |
|---|---|
| Capability | Must map to a named CAP, contract and deterministic test. |
| Evidence | Must include commit, scope, runtime, hashes, provenance and replay reference. |
| Failure/recovery | Must record expected decision, observed decision, recovery and replay. |
| Security | Must use secret scanning, dependency scanning, SBOM and immutable action references where applicable. |
| Review | `CLEAN` is not approval; human and Code Owner review remain separate gates. |
| Promotion | Unknown, missing or external states remain `BLOCKED`, `REVIEW` or `NO_CLAIM`. |

## Repository-specific next gate

The next gate for this surface is a contract-linked vertical slice with a negative test, recovery result and reproducible evidence envelope. If the surface is a presentation or documentation repository, the next gate is source traceability and semantic parity rather than an implementation claim.

## Non-claims

This audit does not claim production operation, certification, absence of vulnerabilities, field validation, commercial traction, vendor exit, federation, autonomous AI authority, independent E3 completion or competitive superiority. A local audit is not remote, field or independent evidence.
