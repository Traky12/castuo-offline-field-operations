# CASTÚO Ecosystem Integration Record — castuo-offline-field-operations

**Snapshot:** 2026-08-22
**Repository role:** offline field operations capability
**Integration mode:** `EVIDENCE-SCOPED · PR-ONLY · FAIL-CLOSED`

## Purpose

This document connects this repository to the current CASTÚO evidence, assurance and resilience envelope without copying unsupported production claims. The canonical system integration remains [Castuo-system PR #358](https://github.com/Traky12/Castuo-system/pull/358); the public profile surface remains [Traky12 PR #18](https://github.com/Traky12/Traky12/pull/18).

## Integrated progress boundary

The shared progress includes the capability chain `CAPABILITY → CONTRACT → IMPLEMENTATION → TEST → EVIDENCE → REPLAY → REVIEW → PROMOTION`, CAP-001 through CAP-008, portable EvidenceObject and AuthorityObject records, offline continuity, recovery, replay, SBOM, secret scanning, action pinning, Code Owner review and fail-closed promotion.

This repository must publish only the capability and evidence that it can reproduce locally. A local pass is `VALIDATED_LOCAL` or `LOCAL_RESULT_NO_CLAIM`; it is not remote, field, commercial or production proof.

## State matrix

| Dimension | Current boundary | Required next gate |
|---|---|---|
| Capability | Role-specific implementation surface | Contract-linked deterministic test |
| Evidence | Evidence-scoped; provenance required | Hash, replay reference and review state |
| Security | CI/security controls are repository-specific | Secret scan, dependency scan, SBOM and pinned Actions |
| Resilience | Offline/recovery claims remain bounded | Failure, recovery and foreign replay |
| Review | Human and independent review pending unless directly recorded | Code Owner, human approval and independent attestation |
| Promotion | `BLOCKED · NO_CLAIM` for production | Remote conformance, field evidence, rollback and explicit authority |

## Required contribution contract

Any future contribution must name its capability ID, contract, commit, scope, runtime, inputs, outputs, hashes, negative tests, recovery behavior, replay command, reviewer, limitations and allowed claim. Unknown or missing values remain `BLOCKED`, `REVIEW` or `NO_CLAIM`.



## Non-claims

This record does not claim production operation, certification, absence of vulnerabilities, field validation, commercial traction, vendor exit, federation, autonomous AI authority or superiority over competitors.
